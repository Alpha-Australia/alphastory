"Nick’s life was marked by grief, addiction, and despair—until a desperate cry led him back to church and then to Alpha. There, a powerful encounter with God turned everything around. Now healed and sober, he shares the hope of Jesus with others.",,http://onemillion.alpha.org.au
"From atheist to evangelist. A conversation over coffee led Sally to question everything. Wrestling with depression, purpose, and science vs faith, she took her questions to Alpha—where she discovered that doubt and belief could coexist.",,
"A family’s faith re-discovered. As Chilli explored Alpha Youth at school, her mum, Elke, felt drawn back to church. Through Alpha, their journey united—now, three generations are active in their parish and have found a daily walk with Jesus.",,
"Sia was born into poverty and        is a single mum and ultra-marathon runner who has been chasing God her whole life, only to realise God was with her all along. ",,
"A doctor, a grim diagnosis, and a divine encounter. Facing stage 4 cancer, Dr. Tridiv cried out to God from his hospital bed - soon after he receieved his healing. Through Alpha and a local pastor’s support, he found faith in Jesus and transitioned from the Hindu faith—now his family in India follows Jesus too.",,
"Struggling with depression and work stress, Evelyn began praying—talking to God like a friend. When God spoke back it changed her. Soon after, she came to church, then Alpha, where she, her husband, and her mum met Jesus and were baptised together. Now she runs Alpha Online, helping others around the world find the same hope.",,
"A Hindu upbringing, a Christmas encounter, and a 20-year prayer answered. 
Neerav had little interest in faith until a Christmas light show led Neerav to an unexpected encounter with the Holy Spirit. Through Alpha, he explored Christianity—only to learn his best friend had prayed for him for two decades.",,
"From the nightclub to the pulpit. After just one visit to church, Rikki was invited to Alpha by the Senior Pastor, where she encountered the Holy Spirit and gave her life to God. Despite a difficult start, with relationship struggles and no faith background, she’s now a pastor running Alpha and continuing to create a safe space for others who feel like they don’t belong in church.",,
This was my first time co-facilitating an Alpha. We have had a core of between six and ten people attending each week. Some are exploring faith and some new Christians looking for how it all works. We initially planned to run this Alpha for six weeks due to Christmas coming up. But in line with participants' wishes we extended two more weeks. Five people made the decision and were baptised and another is planning to when family come up from Sydney next month so he can share his decision and celebrate with them. I tried to wrap up the group but they were so keen to keep meeting and learn/grow that we have decided to continue until we run out of videos at week 16 (two weeks to go). Then we will be meeting once a month over a meal and fun day out. They are so keen to keep in touch with the group and forge deeper bonds with each other and Jesus. Several members have already started to serve in the church or are discovering ways to do this. I have also organised a member of the church team to come and explain connect/home groups to them and assist them with joining one if they choose to. I am writing this with literal tears in my eyes at how grateful I am to have been allowed to stretch myself with co-facilitating my first Alpha. I myself explored a life of faith three years ago when I first walked in the doors at Hillsong Gold Coast and gave my life to Jesus so it feels like a completed full circle for me. There is not enough space here to discuss the many blessings I have received from the Lord and I am compelled to share this with all I meet so they may have this opportunity too. Blessings to all and thank you.,,
"Is happy for us to share this video and he shared his written story via text: Hi Kaela, 
I would be happy to have Alpha utilise that video. Byron and Jessica did an amazing job putting it together. It has touched so many people I have no doubt there has been divine influence in the whole thing. That video has already helped many people to come to faith and renew lost faith.  I've been in the Alpha team ever since and have our next Alpha starting on April 29th.
That video is  a powerful tool. Please use it as you see fit. Here's my email for you to send the release form. ..

I am happy to help Alpha in any way I can. I think its time I sat down and wrote out that testimony that everybody (for the last four months) keeps suggesting I do. I'm being told to write it constantly so I'd better do it. Through my small group Pastor, another Pastor on the Alpha team, another Pastor from our Friday Sunrise Bravehearts men's group. 
It will be a big one though. The Holy Spirit  has never left me even though I continually rejected it. I was protected through my 27 years of alcoholism. In the twenty one years of sobriety I have been able to show hundreds and hundreds of men and women the path to sobriety through AA and faith in a higher power. Some say a coincidence. I say a God incident. The Holy Spirit uses me a lot. I normally know when I get the tingles. Sometimes I get the tingles later once the miracle has happened. I am a blessed man and I just keep being me. No ego. Just the Lord's trusted servant. Ive been  pushing Jesus to a lot of people for many years before I was finally given that beautiful filling of the Holy Spirit. I had a hole in me for so long.  It turns out that hole was Jesus shaped. Alpha gave me the Jesus shaped piece of the puzzle. The story before and this incredible journey since Alpha needs to be shared. 

Chris Transcribed video:
I’ve always been looking but in the back of my head it sat empty. I used to have to go to Sunday school when I was young. I didn’t want to but I had no choice. I was in housing commissions and it was a pretty rough area. If I said I was going to church, I probably wasn’t because it wasn’t cool, but I always had a big hole in my life. A hole in my soul.

I filled it with alcohol until I was an alcoholic and I drank hard for 27 years. Alcoholics and drug addicts can understand that… they’re looking to fill that hole. But I didn’t have the guts to be a Christian. You don’t talk about Jesus in the pub. 

When I finally got sober, I thought I found God in AA. But I didn’t find it there. Tried free-masonry and I couldn’t find it there. But over the years I’d been popping in to church. But I was always the hard bloke, I didn’t want to be soft, because in the back of my head, I couldn’t afford to be soft. I didn’t want to be a weirdo.

I’d walk in the door and hope I find it. So I go in to church. And then I’d go back the next week. And there was always that emptiness all the time. I dont know what I was expecting, someone to wave a magic wand, but it never happened.

If I had’ve known then for Jesus to open my heart then that would’ve been a different story. But I went through Alpha and it did happen. Somehow Alpha opened my heart.

I sat through the whole thing, probably because there’s a free feed. By the time I finished it, I wanted to do it again only this time with an open heart. And the second time I went with a whole different attitude. And I was listening different, and it filled me more.

I learnt to listen to understand, instead of listening to respond. I just came to listen. And then I could make up my mind. 

I still have a long way to go and I still have a lot of doubts, but I’ve got people I can talk to and now I like going to church. I can accept love now, and I couldn’t do that before because it was all about me. And I realise I can actually love somebody else. And that feels pretty good because that’s the hole I’ve had for years.

It was a lonely place. But it’s not anymore because I’m full now.

"I'm the volunteer leader of Alpha at our church. I came to faith on Alpha 22 years ago at HTB, London. Ever since then my wife and I have run Alpha. We've seen God move in so many people's lives. We feel like we have a front row seat where we get to see the Holy Spirit move. We joined Meridan Community Church, a recent church plant, and are loving train up and develop leaders as we build a consistent rhythm of running Alpha at least 3 times a year from 2024 onwards.

"Poem about returning to faith from Alpha Attendee who committed their life to Christ:

 
I have wandered, lost in the noise of life,

chasing shadows, believing that peace could be found in all the wrong places.

I turned my back, not realising that You were always there, waiting with open arms.

 

The years have been heavy, the weight of regret and distance pressing on my chest,

but in the quiet, I hear Your voice, gentle, steady, inviting me to come home.

 

There is no shame in this return, only grace,

the kind of grace that never lets go,

never abandons, even when I stray far and long.

 

I don’t need to prove myself,

only to be willing to walk back into Your light. I sit with You now, not as a stranger,

but as one who is known, one who is loved beyond measure.

 

No more running, no more searching, because I know where true peace lives.

I am here, not perfect, but open, ready to be renewed by the love that has always been waiting for me.

 

Your arms are still open, and I am finally home. Today I return to you Christ, my Lord, my Saviour, my King.

"I did the first Alpha course the year before last I had no expectations about it. What I read was, Ask questions, but don’t expect an answer.
I found lots of answers to how my life had been going. I started off being a depressed person who had no meaning in my life. I also wore the tag of an abused child and an abused woman in my marriage. Then my daughter died and I became the woman who had been abused and whose daughter had died.
That is what I went into the Alpha course with. No expectations about how God would heal me. I was also in a lot of pain due to arthritis in my spine and my knee. I often used a wheelchair to get around.
The last week of the course we sang some hymns. I found myself singing in a voice that was not mine. I didn’t understand what was happening. After the songs had finished, I realise the Holy Spirit had come to me. I will never forget how I felt.
The last exercise was a prayer circle, I sat in the middle and was asked what I wanted people to pray for me. My reply was my arthritis was my biggest concern, not that you can do anything about it. Oh yea of little faith. I went home and the next morning my pain had gone from an 8 to a 2. I have not used a wheelchair since.
I now now what it is really like to call God my SAVIOUR.
My life is so different now. People have said how different I look, how I am not negative any more. I had a disagreement with someone and I actually challenged them, I have never done that before. I feel so confident of Gods love for me.",,
"""Alpha sparked my exploration into something far deeper than I expected. Strangely enough, it wasn’t even my first time at Alpha that I came to faith. It was over a year later, outside of that space, that I truly opened the door between me and God. But I needed that starting point. I needed that room to explore freely — and most importantly, I needed to start asking the right questions."" ",,

"My name's Phil. I live in Brisbane in Queensland. I'm married. I have two adult children. 

How did I come to Alpha?

I've been riding or cycling for some 10 to 15 years. In 2013, my oldest lad asked me if I'd like to join a group called Altitude. He'd been riding with them, for a few weeks and really liked the people. And, I didn't really wanna go to be quite honest because, I heard that the altitude crew were mainly Christians. So I kinda resisted for a few weeks.

And then, one morning, Matt got up and he said, ""come on, join me on a ride"". And I thought, oh, why not? And so I kind of enjoyed the morning, and then I started riding with him on a regular basis. I think back in 2015, before coming to Christ, that I was probably close to being suicidal. I just didn't know how to do it.

It's just, it was one of those things. But I also felt that, you know, with my family that I couldn't let them down. I was still, you know, that would have been a very difficult thing to do, but there was also the thing that I probably could have just abandoned everything that left home and lived on the streets. It was that close. I was able to share that with with these guys, which I wouldn't share with lots of other groups, but because of the relationship that we built with these guys and their character, I felt quite comfortable in doing that. From that conversation that evening, Rod rang me up and, asked me to come to Alpha.

So the night that I rolled up at Alpha, it was, it took me by surprise. I hadn't really been to church, and and that's the thing too. I've not been to church for at that stage for some 40 years.

And the first thing I noticed in there was that, it was a very welcoming, very loving, and and they engaged me, and they asked me questions. We had the video, which I really enjoyed. And I went away and thought about that a lot, the following week and actually looked forward to the second session. And again, the questions, the video was really good. I really liked the the topics and, they really sort of started to open my mind up to to thinking about that through the week.

By the the third week, I was pretty much all in. I remember drive driving home that night and thinking, wow, this is probably the best thing I've ever done. 

My world was just collapsing around me. I'd lived in internally relying on my own strength to live through the the difficult times, and I couldn't do that anymore. And now through Alpha, it's opened up that I can actually lean on on Jesus, and and that now I go to church regularly, still mentored through Rod, and the other Christians I know.",,
"We have been running Alpha twice a year at St Emilie's since Oct 2023. I find that the team have grown through each of the series. Our prayer lives have deepened; our relationships have grown, and the team is willing and generous with their time and resources. 
Those who have attended have testified to the love within the group, many have said that they now have a Christian family, and they feel part of the church. We have seen more people come and volunteer and every Ministry in the church has seen a growth and new life. 
Many have stated they grew deeper in their faith and they have hope. One man stated he was blind but now he sees.  Another stated he attended church for the last 16 years but left immediately after mass. But from the time he did Alpha 2 years ago, he has got to know more people than he had in the past. Entire families are being changed - we have concurrent youth Alpha series running and so the entire family can attend.
The shift has changed, now those who attend want to spread the good news and spread Alpha to other churches in Perth. 
God has filled our hearts and continues to build us. Praise his Holy name",,
"We ran our first Alpha Youth, and saw over 50 young people come to our launch party. Witnessing the young people get to know Jesus and understand who he is, watching them connect and converse, and praying for each other has been an absolute joy and life changing experience for me as a leader.",,
17 young people were baptised at the end of last year. They had all done youth alpha. Half were from non churched backgrounds. There is a distinct outcome that is evident in adults and young people who complete Alpha. Something is “settled” in their mind and “open” in their spirit. Praise God.,,

"For a long time, I viewed the world through a lens tinted with negativity, convinced it was a place filled with darkness. My childhood was marked by the constant turmoil of my parents' relationship. My father's struggles with gambling and unfaithfulness ultimately led to their divorce, a turbulent period that reshaped our family life. In the aftermath, we moved interstate to be nearer to my mother's relatives, hoping for a fresh start. Tragically, this new chapter was abruptly cut short. Within a year, a home robbery claimed my mother's life, leaving an irreplaceable emptiness in our hearts.
 
Following this heartbreak, my father stepped up to care for my siblings and me. Yet, I found myself trapped in a tangle of anger and blame. I often thought that had our family not been so fractured, my mother might have been spared. My resentment was directed towards my father, whom I blamed for her being alone and, consequently, her tragic fate. As time went on, this silent bitterness began to melt away, opening the door to a better relationship with my father. But just as we were starting to reconnect, cancer took him away from us. During these years, my world was one of fear and distrust. I saw danger and deceit around every corner, a perspective forged by the continuous challenges of my early life.
 
It was amidst this landscape of grief and disillusionment that I encountered Alpha, introduced by a friend. Initially, I approached Christianity with a blend of curiosity and scepticism, perceiving it as another philosophical system for navigating life's challenges. However, Alpha unveiled a new dimension of Christianity to me - one that was deeply personal and rooted in evidence, inviting me into a relationship with Jesus.
 
This journey with Alpha was transformative. It provided a space for deep, meaningful connections, contrasting starkly with my previous superficial relationships. The program's discussions about life, love, and forgiveness opened my eyes to conversations of a depth I had never experienced. The personal growth I encountered at Alpha was profound, facilitated by the genuine care of the leaders and the welcoming community that felt like a family of once-strangers.
 
A pivotal moment in my Alpha journey was when I encountered C.S. Lewis' compelling quote about Jesus, which challenged my previous perceptions and led me to recognise Him as the Son of God, not merely a historical figure. This quote resonated deeply, aligning with my growing understanding and acceptance of faith.

A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic–on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg–or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse.
 
Alpha became a sanctuary where I could explore doubts and questions about Christianity in a judgment-free environment. In this nurturing environment, I found the comfort and safety to open up about the traumas of my childhood. It encouraged me to seek wisdom, ask challenging questions about faith, and continuously refine my beliefs. This experience didn't just change my beliefs; it transformed my entire life's trajectory. Alpha was instrumental in my healing process, aiding me in understanding the complexities of a fractured world and guiding me towards embracing a relationship with Jesus.",,

"I was nervous about Alpha...but it didn't take me long to realise that God had put me right where I was meant to be. In the tenth week, we discussed 'Does God Heal Today?'. I spent that night with a thought looming in my mind about my injured shoulders. At the end of the session, [we were offered prayer for healing]. Usually, I don't expect much as far as miracles go, but it felt right to expect it this time. I felt a warmth spill across my body...I hesitantly lifted my left shoulder, which had been in a great deal of pain minutes earlier. I remember the disbelief when my shoulder continued to lift and the pain never came. I began to move my right shoulder, which had been injured in a car accident...a range of movement my surgeon told me would never be possible again. I looked at my partner, Ella, and said, ""Look! It's not supposed to be able to do that!",,
