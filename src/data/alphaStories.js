      "I have wandered, lost in the noise of life, chasing shadows, believing that peace could be found in all the wrong places. I turned my back, not realising that You were always there, waiting with open arms. The years have been heavy, the weight of regret and distance pressing on my chest, but in the quiet, I hear Your voice, gentle, steady, inviting me to come home. There is no shame in this return, only grace, the kind of grace that never lets go, never abandons, even when I stray far and long. I don't need to prove myself, only to be willing to walk back into Your light. I sit with You now, not as a stranger, but as one who is known, one who is loved beyond measure. No more running, no more searching, because I know where true peace lives. I am here, not perfect, but open, ready to be renewed by the love that has always been waiting for me. Your arms are still open, and I am finally home. Today I return to you Christ, my Lord, my Saviour, my King.",

    story:
      "I did the first Alpha course the year before last I had no expectations about it. What I read was, Ask questions, but don't expect an answer. I found lots of answers to how my life had been going. I started off being a depressed person who had no meaning in my life. I also wore the tag of an abused child and an abused woman in my marriage. Then my daughter died and I became the woman who had been abused and whose daughter had died. That is what I went into the Alpha course with. No expectations about how God would heal me. I was also in a lot of pain due to arthritis in my spine and my knee. I often used a wheelchair to get around. The last week of the course we sang some hymns. I found myself singing in a voice that was not mine. I didn't understand what was happening. After the songs had finished, I realise the Holy Spirit had come to me. I will never forget how I felt. The last exercise was a prayer circle, I sat in the middle and was asked what I wanted people to pray for me. My reply was my arthritis was my biggest concern, not that you can do anything about it. Oh yea of little faith. I went home and the next morning my pain had gone from an 8 to a 2. I have not used a wheelchair since. I now know what it is really like to call God my SAVIOUR. My life is so different now. People have said how different I look, how I am not negative any more. I had a disagreement with someone and I actually challenged them, I have never done that before. I feel so confident of Gods love for me.",

      "Alpha sparked my exploration into something far deeper than I expected. Strangely enough, it wasn't even my first time at Alpha that I came to faith. It was over a year later, outside of that space, that I truly opened the door between me and God. But I needed that starting point. I needed that room to explore freely — and most importantly, I needed to start asking the right questions.",

      "I joined the next round of alpha and the way that God began to change my life from that point on was nothing short of miraculous. For me Alpha started as a safe place where I could explore my new found faith and ask any question. For me Alpha is more than just a course, its a gateway into a discipled life which is ultimately a life that God can speak into and speak through.",

    name: "Phil",
    church: "Unknown",
    story:
      "My name's Phil. I live in Brisbane in Queensland. I'm married. I have two adult children. How did I come to Alpha? I've been riding or cycling for some 10 to 15 years. In 2013, my oldest lad asked me if I'd like to join a group called Altitude. He'd been riding with them, for a few weeks and really liked the people. And, I didn't really wanna go to be quite honest because, I heard that the altitude crew were mainly Christians. So I kinda resisted for a few weeks. And then, one morning, Matt got up and he said, 'come on, join me on a ride'. And I thought, oh, why not? And so I kind of enjoyed the morning, and then I started riding with him on a regular basis. I think back in 2015, before coming to Christ, that I was probably close to being suicidal. I just didn't know how to do it. It's just, it was one of those things. But I also felt that, you know, with my family that I couldn't let them down. I was still, you know, that would have been a very difficult thing to do, but there was also the thing that I probably could have just abandoned everything that left home and lived on the streets. It was that close. I was able to share that with with these guys, which I wouldn't share with lots of other groups, but because of the relationship that we built with these guys and their character, I felt quite comfortable in doing that. From that conversation that evening, Rod rang me up and, asked me to come to Alpha. So the night that I rolled up at Alpha, it was, it took me by surprise. I hadn't really been to church, and and that's the thing too. I've not been to church for at that stage for some 40 years. And the first thing I noticed in there was that, it was a very welcoming, very loving, and and they engaged me, and they asked me questions. We had the video, which I really enjoyed. And I went away and thought about that a lot, the following week and actually looked forward to the second session. And again, the questions, the video was really good. I really liked the the topics and, they really sort of started to open my mind up to to thinking about that through the week. By the the third week, I was pretty much all in. I remember drive driving home that night and thinking, wow, this is probably the best thing I've ever done. My world was just collapsing around me. I'd lived in internally relying on my own strength to live through the the difficult times, and I couldn't do that anymore. And now through Alpha, it's opened up that I can actually lean on on Jesus, and and that now I go to church regularly, still mentored through Rod, and the other Christians I know.",

    church: "St Emilie's Catholic Church, Perth",
    story:
      "We have been running Alpha twice a year at St Emilie's since Oct 2023. I find that the team have grown through each of the series. Our prayer lives have deepened; our relationships have grown, and the team is willing and generous with their time and resources. Those who have attended have testified to the love within the group, many have said that they now have a Christian family, and they feel part of the church. We have seen more people come and volunteer and every Ministry in the church has seen a growth and new life. Many have stated they grew deeper in their faith and they have hope. One man stated he was blind but now he sees. Another stated he attended church for the last 16 years but left immediately after mass. But from the time he did Alpha 2 years ago, he has got to know more people than he had in the past. Entire families are being changed - we have concurrent youth Alpha series running and so the entire family can attend. The shift has changed, now those who attend want to spread the good news and spread Alpha to other churches in Perth. God has filled our hearts and continues to build us. Praise his Holy name",

There is a distinct outcome that is evident in adults and young people who complete Alpha. Something is 'settled' in their mind and 'open' in their spirit. Praise God.",

    story:
      "For a long time, I viewed the world through a lens tinted with negativity, convinced it was a place filled with darkness. My childhood was marked by the constant turmoil of my parents' relationship. My father's struggles with gambling and unfaithfulness ultimately led to their divorce, a turbulent period that reshaped our family life. In the aftermath, we moved interstate to be nearer to my mother's relatives, hoping for a fresh start. Tragically, this new chapter was abruptly cut short. Within a year, a home robbery claimed my mother's life, leaving an irreplaceable emptiness in our hearts. Following this heartbreak, my father stepped up to care for my siblings and me. Yet, I found myself trapped in a tangle of anger and blame. I often thought that had our family not been so fractured, my mother might have been spared. My resentment was directed towards my father, whom I blamed for her being alone and, consequently, her tragic fate. As time went on, this silent bitterness began to melt away, opening the door to a better relationship with my father. But just as we were starting to reconnect, cancer took him away from us. During these years, my world was one of fear and distrust. I saw danger and deceit around every corner, a perspective forged by the continuous challenges of my early life. It was amidst this landscape of grief and disillusionment that I encountered Alpha, introduced by a friend. Initially, I approached Christianity with a blend of curiosity and scepticism, perceiving it as another philosophical system for navigating life's challenges. However, Alpha unveiled a new dimension of Christianity to me - one that was deeply personal and rooted in evidence, inviting me into a relationship with Jesus. This journey with Alpha was transformative. It provided a space for deep, meaningful connections, contrasting starkly with my previous superficial relationships. The program's discussions about life, love, and forgiveness opened my eyes to conversations of a depth I had never experienced. The personal growth I encountered at Alpha was profound, facilitated by the genuine care of the leaders and the welcoming community that felt like a family of once-strangers. A pivotal moment in my Alpha journey was when I encountered C.S. Lewis' compelling quote about Jesus, which challenged my previous perceptions and led me to recognise Him as the Son of God, not merely a historical figure. This quote resonated deeply, aligning with my growing understanding and acceptance of faith. Alpha became a sanctuary where I could explore doubts and questions about Christianity in a judgment-free environment. In this nurturing environment, I found the comfort and safety to open up about the traumas of my childhood. It encouraged me to seek wisdom, ask challenging questions about faith, and continuously refine my beliefs. This experience didn't just change my beliefs; it transformed my entire life's trajectory. Alpha was instrumental in my healing process, aiding me in understanding the complexities of a fractured world and guiding me towards embracing a relationship with Jesus.",

      "I was nervous about Alpha...but it didn't take me long to realise that God had put me right where I was meant to be. In the tenth week, we discussed 'Does God Heal Today?'. I spent that night with a thought looming in my mind about my injured shoulders. At the end of the session, [we were offered prayer for healing]. Usually, I don't expect much as far as miracles go, but it felt right to expect it this time. I felt a warmth spill across my body...I hesitantly lifted my left shoulder, which had been in a great deal of pain minutes earlier. I remember the disbelief when my shoulder continued to lift and the pain never came. I began to move my right shoulder, which had been injured in a car accident...a range of movement my surgeon told me would never be possible again. I looked at my partner, Ella, and said, 'Look! It's not supposed to be able to do that!'",
